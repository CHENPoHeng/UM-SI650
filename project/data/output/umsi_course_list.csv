University of Michigan School of Information,SI617,Choice Architecture,"Designing a system or organization for humans requires understanding not just choice and behavior motivations (good in most cases, we hope), but also learning about the reasons we blunder and make mistakes.  Thus, even when incentives are ""aligned"" with overall system goals, there are many instances where we make poor choices because as human beings, we are all susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of unwanted and unintended outcomes and decisions.  Our errors are what make us human, but up until now, they have been largely ignored by systems designers, whether these designers make complex public policy, manage a team or design an information system.  But knowing how people think, we can become choice architects who design environments that both yield better decision making on the part of users, and achieve behavior that is consistent with overall system goals while gaining a competitive design-edge.

The first goal of this course is to inform future information system professionals, designers and managers about human decision rules and their associated biases so that these insights can be incorporated into their design, business or management strategies.  Knowledge of these issues can be a significant source of competitive advantage because they are unknown to most information systems professionals and they are not taught in most I-schools.  The second goal of this course is to clarify how these results can be leveraged to create original and more effective systems and institutions that meet the designer's goals.

University of Michigan School of Information,SI632,Appraisal of Archives,"This course examines the archivist's ""first responsibility,"" the appraisal of records in all media for long-term preservation.  The responsibility is ""first"" because appraisal comes first in the sequence of archival functions and thus influences all subsequent archival activities, and its ""first"" in importance because appraisal determines what tiny silver of the total human documentary production will actually become ""archives"" and thus part of society's collective memory.  The archivist is thereby actively shaping the future's history of our own times. 

This course begins with the theoretical foundations of appraisal and the controversial responsibility of assigning cultural value to some documentary artifacts and not others, within a broader context of history and memory.  Sessions on the evolution of appraisal thinking, and different appraisal experiences, in Europe, the United States, Canada, and Australia, follow.  With this background, the course will focus on examples from the real world of appraisal strategy and methodology, including electronic records.  Attention will be paid to personal and private records as well as government and institutional ones.  The class will end by trying to apply the theories and methodologies through group projects to various recording media and functional areas of records creation, these reflecting student interests.

The goal of the course is to provide students through readings and discussion with a thorough knowledge of the basic theories, strategies, and professional practices concerning appraisal and an orientation to doing this job well as working archivists.",3,SI 580 or Permission of Instructor,

University of Michigan School of Information,SI636,"Makerspaces, Maker Culture, Maker Tools","Do you wish you could create solutions that are custom-fit to your needs instead of buying other people's products? The maker movement makes that possible. Makerspaces represent a convergence of rejuvenated interest in do-it-yourself (DIY) practice with technological advances that have democratized access to low-cost, open-source resources. 
 
Makerspaces (also known as hackerspaces) have their roots in centuries-old practices such as guilds or county fairs. Today's makerspaces are communal or community spaces in which creators of all kinds - known as makers - come together with shared resources to tinker, prototype, swap ideas and expertise, experiment playfully, create, and iterate. Some see the maker movement as a novel approach to manufacturing: lean and nimble, with a rapid, technology-infused pathway from prototyping to manufacture. Others see making as an extension of the human experience, wrapping crafters, coders, artisans, hobbyists, and entrepreneurs under its umbrella, across the novice to expert continuum. Still others see making as a means to survival. Regardless, maker culture is collegial, built on open-source hardware and software and a free and generous sharing of ideas. 
 
This course explores makerspaces, maker culture, and the open-source, low-cost microcontroller tools (such as Arduino, Lilypad, and Grove) that accelerate maker tinkering. In this course, you are a maker. Through readings, discussion, design charrettes, and hands-on building, you'll construct insights, strategies, and skills to bring your ideas and inventions to life. Note: given the availability of existing open-source code available online for these platforms, this course focuses less on programming code than on deploying existing code.",3,,SI 501 & 502
University of Michigan School of Information,SI637,Research Seminar on Archives and Institutions of Social Memory,"This course is a research seminar. Readings, discussions, and assignments focus on the central
themes of the seminar: how collective memory is constructed and transferred over time and what roles documents, artifacts, and archival institutions play in capturing, conveying, and distorting collective memory. To accomplish this we explore a range of theories of collective memory, the historical relationships between orality and literacy, and postmodern perspectives on archives and why ""the archive"" has become a problematic concept. We examine the shifting connections between history, archives, and memory, as well as explore the relationships between memory and heritage, identity, and trauma. Different methodological approaches are reviewed to uncover how collective memory is mediated through phases of creation, dissemination, and reception.
