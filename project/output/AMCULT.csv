b'AMCULT',b'433',b' Made in Detroit: A History of Art and Culture in the Motor City ',"b'\n\n\n\nThe embodiment of ""Modern Times"" was the assembly line and Detroit, dubbed ""the capital of the Twentieth Century"" played an important symbolic role in the modern imagination. Yet while  artists depicted Detroit\'s industry as an abstract emblem of twentieth century progress \xe2\x80\x94 and later of dystopian decline \xe2\x80\x94 the city has a complicated labor, racial, and political history that makes it and its art different from that of any other place. \r\n\r\nThis seminar examines how Detroit has been presented in modern art, and the role that the arts and architecture have played in the city from the 1880\'s to the present. We will consider both works produced in Detroit that defined technology and urban culture for the world, and those that have particular local histories from the sleek factories that heralded modern architecture in America to the artificial past that Henry Ford assembled at Greenfield Village, from the heroic worker figures of Diego Rivera\'s murals to the controversies surrounding the Joe Louis monument and the Heidelberg Project, from \xe2\x80\x9cruin porn\xe2\x80\x9d and gentrification to prospects for the future. Students are encouraged to attend two day-long field trips which will include a visit to the exhibition \xe2\x80\x9cDiego Rivera and Frida Kahlo in Detroit\xe2\x80\x9d at the Detroit Institute of Arts. \r\n\r\n\r\nRequired texts  (also on reserve) will include Terry Smith, Making the Modern; F. W. Taylor, Principles of Scientific Management; Karen Lucic, Charles Sheeler and the Cult of the Machine;\r\nThomas Sugrue, The Origins of the Urban Crisis; Walter Gropius, The New Architecture and the Bauhaus.\r\n\r\n\r\n HISTART category for concentration distributions: D.

In this seminar, we will seek to focus each session on a different topic, such as the origin of ethnic stratification, race, and racism; the contrasting theoretical explanations of assimilation and internal colonialism for the reality of group differences in social outcomes in America; the different levels of analysis, micro vs. macro approaches to immigration; the causes and consequences of the differential incorporation of immigrants in American society; political vs. economic immigrants as different social types; middleman minorities vs. the ethnic enclave vs. the ethnic economy as models of immigrant adaptation; women and migration; and social networks and gender as the link between micro and macro levels of analysis.Course Requirements:The goal of this seminar is for each student to work on a paper on a topic of his or her own choosing that relates to immigration, race, and ethnicity.

The reading list is deliberately expansive in scope, cutting across multiple hemispheres, much of the past three centuries, and competing approaches from U.S. cultural history, American studies, and British cultural studies. In so doing, it takes a capacious approach to \xe2\x80\x9cculture\xe2\x80\x9d itself. In some cases, we\xe2\x80\x99ll focus on culture in the aesthetic senses: high and low, visual and textual, vernacular and commercial. But at other moments, we\xe2\x80\x99ll look at culture in the broader anthropological modes of customs, traditions, and values. Above all, we\xe2\x80\x99ll explore \xe2\x80\x9cthe cultural\xe2\x80\x9d as an evolving set of methodological approaches now being applied to sources and subjects previously understood as the provinces of other subfields. One of our central questions, in fact, will involve the long-term effects and future directions of the \xe2\x80\x9ccultural turn,\xe2\x80\x9d a phenomenon now described as the most important disciplinary development of the late 20th century. Simply put: what is cultural history now? How has it changed in recent decades, and where is it moving in the current conjuncture? One final note: in early April, I will be running a national conference at UM entitled ""A New Materialism? Rethinking Global Capitalism at the Nexus of Culture and Political Economy."" This event will include a number of U.S. cultural historians from around the country: Kathleen Brown, Andrew Zimmerman, Seth Rockman, Alison Isenberg, Nan Enstad, Elspeth Brown, Nathan Connolly, and possibly 1-2 others. The plan is to include recent work by many of these scholars as part of the reading list for History 686.

These women filmmakers have been left out of most established histories of Latin American cinema. This course will consider the films of diverse women filmmakers in relation to national film movements, transnational  feminist projects, and international art cinema circuits in order to articulate their position within Latin American cinema history. \r\n\r\nThe course is loosely organized around film mode. The first part of the course considers fiction filmmaking in Latin American cinema, from the work of women film pioneers who contributed to the development of the early cinema and the New Latin American Cinema to more contemporary women authors. Alongside these feature-length fiction films, we will study the evolution of feminist film criticism in Anglo-European Film Studies as a project that reinvented the cinema in relationship to women\xe2\x80\x99s subjectivity and women\xe2\x80\x99s points of view, in order to adopt and adapt its methods in discussing women\xe2\x80\x99s filmmaking from Latin America.

Later, President James Monroe\xe2\x80\x99s 1823 challenge to Europeans monarchs if they attempted further expansion in the Americas seemed to confirm that the US was fundamentally anti-imperialist. Yet, this stance had been earlier contradicted in 1819 when Monroe obtained congressional funding to fund the privately owned American colony of Liberia, West Africa, the capital of which (Monrovia) was named in his honor.\nSome twenty-five years later the United States fought an expansionist war with Mexico (1846-1848), which yielded territories that later became Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, and Utah. In 1898 the United States annexed what had been the sovereign nation of Hawaii, while at the same time fighting a so-called anti-imperial war on Spain in support of Cuban and Filipino independence movements. But by the end of that year the United States took militarily control of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, which then set the nation at odds with island revolutionaries.\nOver one hundred years later, and long after the demise of old European empires, the United States is on the one hand vilified as the reincarnation of Imperial Rome, while also expected on the other hand to intervene in anti-totalitarian revolutions in North Africa and the Middle East.

Dubois for his work on race theory which continues to be the foundational work of all academic and intellectual projects on critical race theory. Ida B. Wells Barnett radically changed the entire view of Black masculinity in America by her relentless attack on lynching. Her work still resonates today where Black manhood is still under siege. Muhammad Ali represents in the world what greatness means. He was not only a great athlete but his genius was that he changed the paradigm of what an athlete should be. He was a fierce race man, speaking fearlessly against the injustices suffered by his people while occupying a space of reverence in the world for him and his boxing accomplishments. Michael Jackson has shifted the paradigm of popular music in America and in the world. Popular music is no longer about singing, it is about performing, dancing and style. It is now both aural and visual. This is the legacy of Michael Jackson who is an American genius, his art being a syncretism of the powerful African and African American traditions of music and performance as well as the musical masters of American theatre and film. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this class are: \r\n\n\r\nTo familiarize the students with the work and accomplishment of these four persons \r\nTo examine these lives and evaluate whether their genius is understood and whether their contributions are given their proper place as Americans or are they celebrated only in African American communities. \r\nCritically examine genius and how race impacts this in the U.S. and in the world \r\nThrough writing projects produce pieces that might be considered publishable either in blogs or other media. \r\n\nThe texts and readings in the class as well as visual material will be used as the foundation to build ideas for writing.
