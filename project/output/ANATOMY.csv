b'ANATOMY',b'504',b' Cellular Biotechnology ',"b'Course overview/description:\r\nBiotechnology is a rapidly evolving and highly multi-disciplinary field that impacts nearly every\r\naspect of our daily lives from the food we eat to the medicine we take. This one-semester, 3-\r\ncredit course provides an overview and integration of several disparate disciplines that together\r\ndefine the field of cellular biotechnology. Topics this year will include: (1) commercialization\r\nstrategies and technology evaluation, (2) microtechnologies, (3) fluorescence and FRET, (4)\r\nDNA repair and control of gene expression, (5), protein engineering, (6) translational control\r\nmechanisms and assay development, (7) stem cells, tissue engineering, and regenerative\r\nmedicine, (8) gene editing technologies, (9) immune-bioengineering, and (10) drug delivery, and\r\n(11) regulatory affairs.\r\nEmphasis will be placed not only on the basic scientific and engineering principles behind the\r\ngrowing field of biotechnology, but also on the entrepreneurial aspects of translating innovative\r\nsolutions into new commercial products.\r\nThis course is cross-listed with the Departments of Anatomy; Biological Chemistry; Microbiology\r\n& Immunology; and Biomedical Engineering.Course Requirements:Grading criteria:\r\nStudent performance will be evaluated in three ways:\r\n\n Homework: Brief homework assignments (4) based on lecture content and supplemental\r\nreadings will be given out throughout the semester. 25% of the grade\r\n Class Participation: Attendance, questions asked, and comments made in class will be\r\ntallied by the instructor. 25% of the grade\r\n Projects: The main assignment of this course is a team-based project consisting of\r\nformulating, writing, and presenting an innovative biotechnological solution to a problem\r\nthat is related to, or incorporates, some of the topics discussed in class. \r\n\nStudents will be\r\nassigned to small groups (-5/group). Proposals must be cross-disciplinary in approach,\r\ninclude both business motivation and overview as well as scientific innovation in an NIH\r\nSBIR format. Various milestones will be met through the term to keep groups on track\r\n(more details forthcoming). 50% of the final grade'",3,b'Graduate standing or consent of instructor.',"b'http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_detail.aspx?content=2070ANATOMY504001&termArray=f_17_2160,su_17_2150,ss_17_2140,sp_17_2130,w_17_2120,f_16_2110,su_16_2100,ss_16_2090,sp_16_2080,w_16_2070'"
