The course will expose\r\nstudents to the fundamental factual and contextual elements surrounding climate change\r\nin order to facilitate effective participation in the response to realized and predicted\r\nclimate change. The students will work in multi-disciplinary teams on projects to analyze\r\ncurrent real-world problems and to develop strategies to address those problems.\r\n\r\nObjectives\n\n To understand the basic observations and scientific tenets of climate change.\r\n To expose the role of uncertainty in science and how that uncertainty is used by nonscientific\r\ncommunities.\r\n To introduce the issues of fundamental importance at the intersection of climate\r\nchange predictions and different communities: e.g. policy, business, economics, public\r\nhealth, energy, ecosystems, environmental engineering, information science, journalism,\r\nreligion, etc.\n To develop a technique to analyze and address complex problems with stakeholders\r\nfrom multiple communities.\r\n\nClass Materials\r\nThere is no specific textbook, as the course uniquely integrates material from several\r\nfields. There is a reading list, and all of the material in the reading list is available on\r\nline. The reading list includes basic introductory material on climate science, and often\r\nrelies on reports from the National Academy of Sciences and the Intergovernmental Panel\r\non Climate Change. Material that covers the non-scientific communities that are\r\naddressed in the course rely on survey articles in academic journals, reports by nongovernmental\r\norganizations, and web resources.
