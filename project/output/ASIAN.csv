b'ASIAN',b'416',b' Possessing Culture: Mediumship and Ethnography in Southeast Asia ',"b'From factory floors in Malaysia, to Karoland, to Chiang Mai, from Central Java, to Bicol, to the Meratus Mountains, from Aceh, to Mount Banahaw, to Kuala Lumpur and beyond, Southeast Asia has provided an exceptionally good locus from which to get accustomed to the phenomena of spirit possession and mediumship. This seminar asks why this is so, whether mediumship and possession reveal a shared regional culture of negotiating power and difference, or, by contrast, if its prevalence in the literature and perceived importance is largely the product of a (mostly American) ethnographic imaginary. To this end we will begin by engaging several of the classic and contemporary debates about Southeast Asian cultures and history, alongside some of the non-region specific theories of possession and mediumship whose logics seem particularly relevant to this context. We will then examine the mediating role that ethnographies of Southeast Asia have played in presenting spirit possession and mediumship as especially productive sites for both illustrating and generating cultural analysis and critical theory.Course Requirements:Response papers: 50% Final paper: 40% Attendance and participation: 10%Intended Audience:This is an advanced seminar in Anthropology and Asian Studies, and will most benefit majors and minors nearing graduation, graduate students, and those with significant background in either Cultural Anthropology or Southeast Asian / Asian Studies.Class Format:Two 90-minute meetings weekly'",3,"b'Some coursework in cultural anthropology or Southeast Asian studies is useful, but not required.'","b'http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_detail.aspx?content=2070ASIAN416001&termArray=f_17_2160,su_17_2150,ss_17_2140,sp_17_2130,w_17_2120,f_16_2110,su_16_2100,ss_16_2090,sp_16_2080,w_16_2070'"
