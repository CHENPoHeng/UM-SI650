b'ARCH',b'609',b' Topics in Disability Studies ',"b'This course provides an interdisciplinary approach to disability studies, including focus on the arts and humanities, natural and social sciences, and professional schools. Some topics include history and cultural representation of disability, advocacy, health, rehabilitation, built environment, independent living, public policy. The point of departure of the course is the idea that disability provides a critical framework that reorients the basic assumptions of various fields of knowledge, from political science to architecture, from engineering to art history, from genetics to law, from public policy to education, from biology to poetry, and so on. Disability Studies views people with disabilities not as objects but as producers of knowledge whose common history has generated a wide variety of art, music, literature, and science infused with the experience of disability. Students will have the opportunity to interact with visiting speakers from a broad range of fields. The course is offered for 1 or 3 credits. Accessible classroom with realtime captioning.

b'ARCH',b'633',b' Sem Ren&Baroque ',"b'\n\n\n\nThis seminar examines the curvilinear forms and theatrical spaces of Baroque architecture in terms of vision\xe2\x80\x94formal, aesthetic, and symbolic goals driven by certain cultural values, and mathematics\xe2\x80\x94the geometrical methods, carried out using simply a straight edge and compass, by which these goals were achieved. We will focus on Bernini and Borromini and their followers in and outside of Italy, considering the cultural context in which they worked (political, social, religious) as well as the technical means available to them (drawing techniques, materials, construction methods). In order to create a foundation for understanding the phenomenon of Baroque form, during the first half of the course we will investigate the ways in which mathematics drove the creation of architecture during the classical, medieval, and Renaissance periods: how proportion and geometry were understood and how they were applied in design. Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to draw parallels between the mathematical basis of form creation in past architecture, including the Baroque, and the methods for creating complex geometries in today\xe2\x80\x99s architecture. The seminar will be comprised of lectures by the instructor, but primarily discussions and student presentations based on assigned readings. Each student will pursue a term-long project on a Baroque building(s) involving historical research, visual documentation, and experimentation with geometrical methods.Course Requirements:No data submittedIntended Audience:No data submittedClass Format:No data submitted'",3,b'ARCH 518/528/permisssion of instructor.',"b'http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_detail.aspx?content=2070ARCH633001&termArray=f_17_2160,su_17_2150,ss_17_2140,sp_17_2130,w_17_2120,f_16_2110,su_16_2100,ss_16_2090,sp_16_2080,w_16_2070'"
b'ARCH',b'503',b' Spec Topc Arch Hist ',"b'From Buenos Aires to New York, the cities of the New World have been sites of speculation and experimentation, as idealized utopias, technopolitical dreams or revolutionary enclaves of resistance. The developmentalist policies of the postwar and the totalitarian governments of the 1960s and 1970s led to political turmoil, rural migration, and uneven investment. We discuss the main cultural, economic, and political discourses that affected the Americas in the twentieth century and the responses or reactions they prompted in the urban and architectural realms. By comparing these responses as a series of case studies, the course assembles a modern history of North, Central, and South American cities as a network of shared and reciprocal influences. \r\n\r\nThis course counts as elective credit toward the Spanish minor.

The thesis option is an independent study opportunity for those students who are sufficiently mature and self-motivated to benefit from self-directed creative work. Arch 660 takes the form of a seminar plus individual tutorials. Each thesis student selects a faculty thesis advisor to work with throughout the year, as well as an outside consultant\xe2\x80\x94a specialist with knowledge of the particular subject matter of the thesis.

b'ARCH',b'509',b' Experimental Course ',"b'The built environment, spatial planning, and designed objects influence how we experience the world. However, design and architecture are themselves shaped by broader forces of social control and cultural power. This course explores the power of design and its limits. How can specific interventions serve to empower or disempower people? What should architects know about a given context before starting to design? Can we devise new design practices to break with dominant systems of production that contribute to global inequity?\r\nCurrently, architecture and design are expanding their disciplinary scope to include planning for social systems, processes, and environments. Meanwhile, anthropology is also increasingly exploring design as an object of study and engaging in collaborations with designers. We will explore how anthropology\xe2\x80\x99s methods differ from those of design thinking and design research. How can criticality and creativity be brought together? What is ethnographic architecture and where might anthropologists fit in a design practice?\r\nIn this course, students of anthropology and architecture will come together to develop a shared vocabulary through discussions and readings in the social theory of space, place, identity, and labor in order to identify and analyze power in its many forms. Students in the course will learn methods ethnography, spatial analysis, and social design critique that they will apply through a final ethnographic project exploring individual questions of interest in design, culture, and society.'",3,b'Year 5 standing and permission of instructor.',"b'http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_detail.aspx?content=2120ARCH509007&termArray=f_17_2160,su_17_2150,ss_17_2140,sp_17_2130,w_17_2120,f_16_2110,su_16_2100,ss_16_2090,sp_16_2080,w_16_2070'"
b'ARCH',b'603',b' Sem Arch History ',"b'In this project-based seminar, students will research, design, and execute a Bicentennial exhibition for the gallery at Taubman College, to be mounted April 2017. This exhibition, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cPresence Past: The UM Campus as Archive\xe2\x80\x9d will highlight two noteworthy periods of modernization within the history of the university\xe2\x80\x99s built environment: the Committee of Five\xe2\x80\x99s interventions during the 1920s and the construction of North Campus through the 1950s and \xe2\x80\x9860s. Students will create exhibits that critically engage the past, using dynamic digital displays and visualizations to evoke UM\xe2\x80\x99s historical relationship with the neotechnical landscapes of industrial Detroit and participation in midcentury American militarization. In doing so, we will not only plumb the existing university archive, but contribute to and expand it through the addition of written material and digital artifacts culled from the exhibition. Our own efforts will be enriched and intensified through interaction with other Bicentennial activities happening across campus, including concurrent LSA Theme courses, the Presidential Colloquia, and an associated architectural Options Studio at TCAUP, \xe2\x80\x9cPast Present,\xe2\x80\x9d taught by Steven Mankouche.  \r\n\r\nThe target constituency of this seminar are PhD students in architecture and historical disciplines, who contribute critical faculties in analysis and research; and MArchs and MFAs, who will bring applicable skills in design and making. The collaborative, project-driven paradigm of this class should appeal both to graduate students pursuing careers in academia, and those looking to broaden their skill sets to appeal to a wider job market.
