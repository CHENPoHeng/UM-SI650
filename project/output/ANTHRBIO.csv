b'ANTHRBIO',b'471',b' Research in Biological Anthropology ',"b'This course teaches laboratory and analysis methods in molecular anthropology. Course objectives depend on student level and will be tailored to meet the needs of various skill-sets. For novice students, it will introduce them to the ways in which molecular data are generated and analyzed to answer questions concerning human evolutionary history. Topics will include an introduction to the basic wet-lab assays and analysis methods used to understand molecular evolution and the origin and history of the human species. More advanced students will be expected to execute a project that obtains and analyzes data related to human evolution.Course Requirements:Students will be evaluated on their wet-lab performance, laboratory notebook upkeep, participation in weekly lab meeting, and their final project.Intended Audience:No data submittedClass Format:No data submitted'",1,b'',"b'http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_detail.aspx?content=2070ANTHRBIO471002&termArray=f_17_2160,su_17_2150,ss_17_2140,sp_17_2130,w_17_2120,f_16_2110,su_16_2100,ss_16_2090,sp_16_2080,w_16_2070'"
b'ANTHRBIO',b'471',b' Research in Biological Anthropology ',"b'This course provides technical training in how to carry out research in Biological Anthropology. This semester, the goal of the course will be to situate dietary and locomotor reconstructions of fossil hominoids from different East African sites in their paleoenviromental context in order to evaluate competing hypotheses relating adaptation to selective forces.  Students will thus be involved in collection and comparative analysis of morphological data (e.g. dental shearing crests, cortical and trabecular structural properties in long bones) and paleonenvironmental data (e.g. stable isotopic sampling of tooth enamel of primates and other herbivores).  Students will be expected to work together to generate primary data and contribute to a collaborative publication.

Weekly discussions will be based on a number of broad topics. We will begin by considering alternative conceptual approaches commonly employed in conservation biology, surveying the role of models in conservation, assessing the present-day conservation status of primate populations and habitats, and discussing the major threats facing wild primate populations. Next, we will consider the connection between conservation biology and ecology, and the relationship between the discipline of conservation biology and the practice of conservation on the ground. We will progress to a discussion of conservation priority setting, strategies and tactics, local human communities as both potential allies and threats to conservation of wild primate populations, and whether or not primates deserve protection and conservation more than other taxa. Over the course of the semester seminar participants will identify topics of particular interest that will be pursued in depth and developed through peer review and discussion, culminating in a term paper and formal presentation.Course Requirements:Grades are calculated based on participation in and preparation for class meetings (30%), a written term paper prospectus (10%), written peer review of other students\xe2\x80\x99 prospecti (10%), a 20 to 25 page term paper (30%), and an oral presentation (20%).

b'ANTHRBIO',b'467',b' Human Behavioral Ecology ',"b'It is often assumed that culture has freed people from the agency of natural selection or that culture is a separate force in people\xe2\x80\x99s lives that exists outside of biology.  This course will explore the proposition that culture/biology is a false dichotomy because biology influences culture and vice versa.  Even features of culture that might seem remote from biology can serve reproductive agendas.  One example is religion.  Both local religions found in small scale societies and world religions that span large geographic areas have sacred tenets that promote male confidence of paternity.  For instance, the menstrual huts of the Dogon religion increase paternity certainty two-fold \xe2\x80\x94 thereby enhancing the reproductive success of males.  Students will gain a thorough understanding of evolutionary theory as applied to human behavior in a wide variety of cultural contexts from the Arctic to New Guinea, Africa to North America.  The readings are scientific articles from the primary literature on such topics as:  reciprocity, inclusive fitness, moral systems, status, parental investment, sexual selection, mating & marriage, and evolutionary medicine.  We will consider the brain as an organ of \r\nphenotypic plasticity that promotes adaptive decision-making and we will examine the proximate mechanisms that promote adaptive outcomes.Course Requirements:Assignments include an 8 page term paper, small group projects, and frequent short quizzes.

Topics will include basic R programming, discussion of various approaches to data analysis, data exploration, statistical modeling, model interpretation, and the visual display of quantitative information. Students will learn how to use the R statistical environment to process, analyze, and visualize data. The instructor will provide R code to execute all example analyses used in class; assignments will entail modifying this code to solve similar problems. Statistical topics will focus primarily on mixed (a.k.a, hierarchical, multilevel) generalized linear models (GLMMs) and formal model comparison using information criteria. Classes on data visualization will help students to learn principled, effective ways to visually depict data using R.Course Requirements:No data submittedIntended Audience:This is not an introductory statistics course.

The objective of the course is for students to develop both a detailed and in-depth knowledge on the most-discussed topics in primatology, as well as an educated opinion on these topics. Each week will be a different topic and graduate students will moderate the discussion at least twice.Course Requirements:As training exercises for selling our 'products' to the increasingly fast-paced academic publishing world, the two main assignments for the course will be (1) to make a stellar 13-minute conference presentation (of your work or someone else's closely-related work), and (2) to re-work an already-published, long, boring paper into a short, sexy one.
