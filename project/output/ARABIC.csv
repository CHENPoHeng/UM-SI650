b'ARABIC',b'507',b' Arabic Syntax and Semantics ',"b'Syntax (usually synonymous with grammar) is the study of phrasal and sentential rules of language or how sounds (or gestures in sign languages) are paired with (syntactic) tree structures to generate phrases and sentences. This course provides a basic understanding of the major syntactic phenomena exhibited in Arabic, using Generative Syntactic Theory, and the formal tools to analyze those phenomena as well as to express theoretical claims and counter claims. Syntactic phenomena covered include:  basic Arabic phrase and clause structures, Arabic subject positions, Arabic sentential agreement, Arabic sentential negation, Arabic wh-interrogation structures, and Arabic pro drop/null subject parameter. \nSemantics is the study of meanings of linguistic expressions (words, phrases, sentences, etc,) which include both grammatical and non-grammatical factors. The former factors relate semantics to syntax more directly insofar as syntactic tree structures relate to meanings and vice versa.  Our semantic approach is not limited to the Generative/Internalist view, but it will also include the externalist/cognitive grammar view. In addition to briefly discussing main issues about the nature of meaning as well as contribution of syntactic structures to sentence interpretation, the course will cover notions related to Arabic case roles and valency, Arabic passive voice, Arabic aspect, Arabic tense, Arabic modality, Arabic definiteness and referentiality, Arabic deixis, and Arabic speech acts/performatives. \nAnalyses of the syntactic and semantic topics discussed take into account primarily Standard Arabic, not to the exclusion of contemporary Arabic dialects.
