b'ANTHRCUL',b'417',b' Possessing Culture: Mediumship and Ethnography in Southeast Asia ',"b'From factory floors in Malaysia, to Karoland, to Chiang Mai, from Central Java, to Bicol, to the Meratus Mountains, from Aceh, to Mount Banahaw, to Kuala Lumpur and beyond, Southeast Asia has provided an exceptionally good locus from which to get accustomed to the phenomena of spirit possession and mediumship. This seminar asks why this is so, whether mediumship and possession reveal a shared regional culture of negotiating power and difference, or, by contrast, if its prevalence in the literature and perceived importance is largely the product of a (mostly American) ethnographic imaginary. To this end we will begin by engaging several of the classic and contemporary debates about Southeast Asian cultures and history, alongside some of the non-region specific theories of possession and mediumship whose logics seem particularly relevant to this context. We will then examine the mediating role that ethnographies of Southeast Asia have played in presenting spirit possession and mediumship as especially productive sites for both illustrating and generating cultural analysis and critical theory.Course Requirements:Response papers: 50% Final paper: 40% Attendance and participation: 10%Intended Audience:This is an advanced seminar in Anthropology and Asian Studies, and will most benefit majors and minors nearing graduation, graduate students, and those with significant background in either Cultural Anthropology or Southeast Asian / Asian Studies.Class Format:Two 90-minute meetings weekly'",3,"b'Some coursework in cultural anthropology or Southeast Asian studies is useful, but not required.'","b'http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_detail.aspx?content=2070ANTHRCUL417001&termArray=f_17_2160,su_17_2150,ss_17_2140,sp_17_2130,w_17_2120,f_16_2110,su_16_2100,ss_16_2090,sp_16_2080,w_16_2070'"

b'ANTHRCUL',b'458',b' Topics in Sociocultural and Linguistic Anthropology ',"b'Anthropologists have a long and rich tradition of addressing social problems in their work, applying anthropological concepts to improve the lives of others, and using anthropology to critique systems of power and knowledge. In recent decades, anthropologists have called for the discipline to become more engaged: to write for public audiences, to carry out more collaborative research projects, and to become more involved in the political challenges of our time. This course considers both the historical roots of these endeavors and recent claims made about these projects. In particular, the course focuses on new forms of engagement, which can be understood as a series of experiments in how to make anthropology and ethnographic knowledge politically relevant. What are the consequences for anthropology when it is conceptualized as a form of political engagement? How might these new projects reshape the field? Are they beneficial or detrimental? Readings include historical works, polemical essays, and a variety of contemporary experiments in different forms of public, collaborative, activist, and engaged anthropology. In addition to informed participation in classroom discussions and writing a literature review reflecting on these issues, students will also carry out small group projects using one of the research methods in question; this exercise is intended to provide insight into the subject matter of the course.Course Requirements:No data submittedIntended Audience:No data submittedClass Format:No data submitted'",3,b'Junior and above.',"b'http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_detail.aspx?content=2070ANTHRCUL458001&termArray=f_17_2160,su_17_2150,ss_17_2140,sp_17_2130,w_17_2120,f_16_2110,su_16_2100,ss_16_2090,sp_16_2080,w_16_2070'"

Topics covered include: models of language as action; the interactional construction of social actors and reference; meaning and intentionality; the role of language in a political economy, and vice versa (the political economy of linguistic forms); the relation of language to social formations and institutions; metalanguage and ideology; the emergence of meanings in interaction; the organization of conversation and other linguistic activities; the linguistic dimension of social and cultural stereotypes; performance and poetics. This year we will give particular attention to the following themes: analytical scales and metrics; the analysis of social events, and their relationship to social formations and linguistic practice.

In the words of anthropologist Robert McKinley: ""Kinship itself is a moral philosophy.  It answers the question of how it is possible for one human being to be morally bound to another.  The strength of a kinship system is based on its ability to draw people into this framework of mutual trust.""  Yet kin relations may also be fraught with violence, ranging from sacrifice to murder; some would argue that kinship and racism are simply different dimensions of the same phenomenon.  This course will focus on the social processes through which people define, create, extend, limit, sever or transform their relatedness with others within and over generations.  We will explore how people conceptualize who is, or is not, their own ""kin"" or ""kind"" and why; the moral imagination involved in working through the contradictory loyalties characterizing even the most intimate, small-scale relations; where, how and why people draw the lines between themselves and other forms of organic life; how generative relations are expressed in forms ranging from substances like blood, milk, or semen, to new reproductive technologies and genetic genealogies; and the significance of places in creating, shaping, containing, transforming relations over time.'",3,b'Graduate standing and permission of instructor.',"b'http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_detail.aspx?content=2070ANTHRCUL632001&termArray=f_17_2160,su_17_2150,ss_17_2140,sp_17_2130,w_17_2120,f_16_2110,su_16_2100,ss_16_2090,sp_16_2080,w_16_2070'"

Perfect communication has been painted in the colors of communion, love, and collective effervescence\xe2\x80\x94and also in the nightmare shades of mind control, hypnotism, and crowd frenzy.  Aspirations and anxieties about such communication have come to enchant us, to move us. Their powers are not matters of individual capacities or responses such as trust or skepticism, but rather, have materialized through tangled historical and social circuits. For one: since the Cold War, Americans and Russians have cultivated connected fascinations with the workings and the failures of communication.  Both sides performed this through accusations of media jamming and propaganda, competing claims to expression and creativity, and mirrored rumors of telepathic connections or interstellar contact.  The book tracks how such preoccupations have marked theoretical models of communication, mediation, and contact, and have infused practical technologies for intuition.'",1,b'',"b'http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_detail.aspx?content=2070ANTHRCUL750001&termArray=f_17_2160,su_17_2150,ss_17_2140,sp_17_2130,w_17_2120,f_16_2110,su_16_2100,ss_16_2090,sp_16_2080,w_16_2070'"

b'ANTHRCUL',b'777',b' Linguistic Anthropology Laboratory ',"b""Linguistic anthropology is a laboratory field. The reasons for it were several. First, we regard graduate training in linguistic anthropology to much more closely resemble an apprenticeship model, than in cultural anthropology. Second, there are new technologies being developed that are increasingly being used in data analysis, including sound and visual analysis of face-to-face interaction. These require special training and resources. And third, but perhaps most importantly, a laboratory model provides a framework for encouraging research collaboration among graduate students and between students and faculty, rather than a model of research as done by a solitary ethnographer. This aspect of the lab framework has worked very well. A single lab-group has met on a regular basis for almost 10 years, discussing papers by visitors, discussing each other's works in progress, and practicing talks for professional meetings and for job interviews. We have succeeded in creating a strongly supportive, cooperative, and nurturing environment for within which students have been able to try out first ideas and first critiques of work by many of the leading figures in the field.
